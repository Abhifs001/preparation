with log_time("Fetch stock data"):

    time.sleep(2)  # simulate API call




#note 
# with log_time("Fetch stock data"):
#     time.sleep(2)  # simulate API call

# This simulates that the Fetch stock data task takes 2 seconds â€” as if you were calling a real trading API like NSE/BSE or fetching data from Alpha Vantage or Bloomberg.4

# with log_time("Fetch stock price"):
#     response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/stocks/TCS")
